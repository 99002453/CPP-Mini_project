The proposed project is a analysis tool implemented using the various concepts of oops such as abstract classes, inheritance, virtual methods and STL, in C++ .The input to the tool is the csv file which is fed with the data of cereals.Features provided are:
The Nutrition analysis mini project will be user by the people to understand the Nutritive value of a specific cereal which he/she is intrested in.
The user can query a specific detail about a desired cereal which has cerain condtions to satisfy.For eg: fat content in the Almond.The amount of calories in raisins.
